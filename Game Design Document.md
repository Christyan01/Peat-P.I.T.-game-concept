# Peat-PIT #
## Overview and vision statement ##
Peat-Pit is a 2.5D RPG centered around two classic yet effective mechanics: defeating monsters and solving puzzles. However, the true heart of the game lies in its dynamic, strategic, and timing-based combat system.
Unlike traditional RPGs, enemies in Peat-Pit don't end their turn after attacking-they continue until their stamina is completely drained. To defend, players must actively respond, choosing the right moment and method to counter each incoming strike.
Each enemy has its own unique move set that players need to recognize and memorize. Players must read the attack patterns and react correctly and with precise timing: pressing the right button, rapidly mashing keys, clicking a specific spot, or moving the mouse in the correct direction.
Offensive actions also require skill: by using the same defensive mechanics, attacks can be powered up to deal more damage and prevent enemies from countering.
Each victory grants experience, rewards, and sometimes allows players to learn a defeated enemy's move, expanding strategic options for future battles.
Turn-based battles are accompanied by exploration across different game areas, where players complete side quests and puzzles to progress and strengthen themselves in preparation for challenging boss fights at the end of each area.
### Look of the game ###
Peat-Pit will feature an HD-2D visual style, blending classic pixel art with modern visual effects such as dynamic lighting, shadows, and depth of field to create a vibrant and immersive world.
To further enhance the game's unique aesthetic, the objective is to incorporate 3D and hand-drawn characters alongside pixel art environments. This stylistic contrast will make the overall visual experience more expressive and memorable. 
However, given the complexity and production costs of this visual direction, early prototypes will focus primarily on pixel art elements, allowing us to refine gameplay mechanics and core systems before expanding into more resource-intensive assets.
## Gameplay ##
* **Combat system**:
Engage in a stamina-based, real-time turn system where enemies don't stop after one attack. Instead, they'll continue their assault until their stamina is depleted, requiring you to stay focused and react quickly to their patterns.
* **Reactive defense mechanics**:
Every incoming attack requires an active response. Choose your reaction based on timing and type of attack:
	- Dodge: avoid damage entirely, at the cost of some stamina;
	- Block: absorb the hit without losing stamina, but take minor health damage;
	-Parry: with perfect timing, cancel the attack completely. Parrying a special attack   	reflects it back to the attacker, dealing damage based on the strength of the original 	move.
* **Reactive attack mechanics**:
Your attacks are not passive. Timing-based inputs, such as precise key presses, mashing, clicking targets, or directional mouse movements, enhance the power of your actions. A well-timed strike will deal more damage and prevent enemy counters.
* **Attack types**:
Type of moves:
	- Physical attacks, common and easier to anticipate;
	- Special attacks, less frequent but more powerful and often harder to counter, 		sometimes requiring unique defensive inputs;
	- Status moves, which don't deal direct damage but alter statistics, buffing allies or 	debuffing enemies to create tactical advantages.
* **Move patterns and progression**:
Each enemy features a unique set of moves. Learning their behavior is key to surviving. Upon defeat, enemies may reward you not only with experience points and items, but also with one of their abilities, which you can add to your arsenal.
* **Character customization**:
Customize your playstyle by swapping mechanical body parts. Each part changes your character's core stats-like speed, stamina, power or defense-and may unlock passive bonuses useful in specific combat scenarios, for example:  a mechanical shield that facilitates parrying by increasing timing windows or reducing stamina cost,  a powerful mechanical arm that boosts attack strength, enhancing damage output.
* **Customizable moveset**:
Before each battle, build your personal move set from the abilities you acquire from the enemies. You can mix and match the to suit your preferred combat style or to exploit enemy weaknesses.
### Level Design ###
Each area in the game features unique enemies, environmental puzzles to solve, and a challenging boss to defeat. The enemies are monsters inspired by the local wildlife that inhabit the specific area, giving each zone its own distinct atmosphere and challenges.
## Characters ##
* **Peat**:
The main character, whose goal is to defeat the evil Dr. Tenma and uncover the truth behind his own death.
* **P.I.T.**:
(Peat's Intelligence Tether) An artificial intelligence housed within Peat's helmet, linked to Peat's own brain. Thanks to P.I.T., players can gather information about enemies and their moves, track their stats, monitor objectives, and navigate the game map.
* **Dr. Netma**:
Peat's father, who brought him back to life and is determined to stop his brother's sinister plan. At key moments in the game, Dr. Netma will contact the player to deliver new pieces of equipment.
* **Dr. Tenma**:
The villain of the story, Dr. Tenma is Dr. Netma's brother who seeks to take control of the island by subjugating its wildlife through waves emitted from his laboratory.
## Story ##
In this game, you will play as Peat, a kid and the son of the biotechnology genius Dr. Netma. You wake up in his laboratory, where you have been brought back to life. Your body is equipped with mechanical prostheses.
Dr. Netma explains how he revived you, giving you a new robotic body integrated with an artificial intelligence called P.I.T. The cause of your death is unknown, but Dr. Netma tells you that his brother, Dr. Tenma, is trying to take control of the island by manipulating its wildlife using waves emitted from his laboratory.
Thanks to your enhanced new body, you must stop Dr. Tenma's plans and restore peace to the island.
However, as the story unfolds, you will discover that Dr. Tenma does not actually exist. The rampaging animals the island are failed experiments created by Dr. Netma himself. He has used you to create a powerful warrior, not only to eradicate his past failures but also to serve as a weapon for his ultimate plan to control the planet. The final confrontation will be against Dr. Netma himself.
## World ##
The first area of the game will be Dr. Netma's laboratory. This area serves as a tutorial for the player, who will face robots specially designed by the doctor to help his son get familiar with his new body. Each battle will introduce and explain different features of the combat system, allowing the player to gradually master the mechanics.
As depicted in the level design section, other areas of the game will be based on different ecosystem of the island (forests, arid deserts, mopunatin peaks, dark caves and more) each inhabited by unique wildlife and environmental challenges.
Scattered throughout the island are small villages where players can rest, purchase items, and participate in various luck-based minigames such as dice rolls or card games, offering both rewards and a break from combat.
